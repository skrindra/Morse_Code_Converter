About Morse code:

morse code is used in telecommunication to encode characters

each character is encoded by **dots(dits) and dashes(dahs)**

- dah = 3 * dit
- each dit or dah separated by signal absence (space—> dit duration)
- intra-character symbol spacing (1 dit)
- letters are spaced by (3 dits)
- word spacing (7 dits)
- light and sound (on-off keys) are used to transmit the signals—> Oooo!!
- length of a symbol = 1/ freq of occurrence of the encoded character
- more frequent the character, shorter the symbol
- E (single dit)
- transmission rate (**groups per min) wpm**
